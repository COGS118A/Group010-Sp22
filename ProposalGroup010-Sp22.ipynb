    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

The genres of the songs are not provided by the Spotify API; rather, we will be using a dataset from Kaggle which contains the genres of many songs. Our metric for performance will be **[TODO]**"

    "Musical genres are often umbrella terms which group songs with very distinct styles. However, some features, such as the rhythm, construction of the drum beat, instrumentation, presence of vocals, and others, can be useful for correctly classifying the genre of a song <a name=\"biss\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#bissnote). According to some, the classification of genres is often socially-driven, rather than based on the features of the songs themselves, placing songs into genres with the intention of targeting specific groups of listeners and making profit <a name=\"tagg\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#taggnote) <a name=\"greenberg\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#greenbergnote).\n",

    "However, relatively recent research uncovered that songs often cluster into three distinct categories: \"“Arousal” (the energy level of the music); “Valence” (the spectrum from sad to happy emotions in the music); and “Depth” (the amount of sophistication and emotional depth in the music)\" <a name=\"greenberg\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#greenbergnote).\n",

    "It would be interesting to understand if other musical features could be useful for classifying songs into genres. This could uncover new rule-sets for music genre recognition by analyzing which features are most associated with which genres. The features present in the Spotify API appear to be promising for this task as they include the features aforementioned of valence, arousal and depth and more. In addition, the Spotify API provides more low-level musical features which can be extracted from the audio signal of a song, and many examples can be found online of people classifying songs into genres based only on these low-level features, with some success <a name=\"venturott\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#venturottnote) <a name=\"elbir\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#elbirnote).\n",

    "Models for genre recognition could be useful for providing features to music recommendation systems, such as Spotify's itself. Furthermore, it is no news that knowing the genre of a song is useful for listeners to find songs they like, however having an automatic approach which only takes into account the actual musical features of a song could make the process faster and more fruitful to users."

Since we will be classifying songs by genres a confusion matrix will help us benchmark our classifier model. The way the confusion matrix works is one has predicted classes on the columns and actual classes on the rows. These predicted and actual classes are matched up for comparison. For example cell (1x1) could represent a true positive for the genre 'Rock' if the first row is an actual classification for 'Rock' and the first row is the predicted classification for 'Rock.' There are True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives. Our data will include the genre of the songs which we will use for our (actual) classification in the matrix. After the confusion matrix is created we will calculate the accuracy of our model with the following:\n",

    "    \\end{align}\n",

    "- When we are deciding which classifier to use we can use an F1-Score for comparison. This test combines the precision and recall of a classifier into a single metric by using their harmonic mean. This will allow us to compare if classifier A has better recall or precision when compared to B then we can further test to see if precision is more important than recall or vice versa. \n",

    "\n",
    "One ethical concern with the datasets we will use is the possible biases. Since we cannot sample randomly from the set of every song in existence on Spotify, we have to resort to using sample datasets with songs that are mostly well known and popular. This might introduce bias into our data as there is a possibility that popular or well known songs share similar audio features. Less popular song genres may be excluded from the model's training dataset, which could have vastly different audio features. As such, our machine learning model may have more difficulty in identifying the correct valence for less well-known songs. One possible solution to this issue is to use a more diverse set of songs as our dataset, but from a realistic perspective it is impossible to sample from every form of music in existence. As such, the only solution is to address that the model we create can only be applied to popular or well-known songs of today."
